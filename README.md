# rock_paper_scissor_game
Script inspired to the "Rock", "Paper", "Scissors" game, this is an exercise from The Odin Project.

In this repository we have the index web page, which in this case is an empty page hosting the link to the main script. The output is available through the browser console.
The main script is made of three functions, the first two collect the input from the user, as a string; the second from the computer, as an integer.
The script playground() compares the two inputs, in this case the string from the user and the integer from the computer to get a result.
For clarity:
The input "Rock" from user equals to 1, 2, 3 from the computer;
The input "Paper" from user equals to 4, 5, 6 from the computer;
The input "Scissors" from user equals to 7, 8, 9 from the computer;
This is my interpretation of the hint given by The Odin project to use the function Math.random(), instead of picking an item from an array to get the computer input.
I hope is the right way.
